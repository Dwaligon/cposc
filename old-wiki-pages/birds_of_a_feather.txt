===== What's a BOF? =====

A Birds of a Feather (BoF) session is an informal meet-up at conferences, where the attendees group together based on a shared interest and carry out discussions without any pre-planned agenda. During the lunch break at the conference, we're hoping people will be able to have some interesting discussions about all sorts of cool topics. If you've got some ideas to spark conversations, share them on this page.
