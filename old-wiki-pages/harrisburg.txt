[[http://www.whitakercenter.org/select-medical-imax-theater.html|IMAX at the Whitaker Center]]: You haven’t seen a movie until you’ve seen an IMAX movie. Central PA’s biggest screen turns any movie into a total immersion experience. The screen itself is 65 feet high and 80 feet wide. That’s a full six stories tall. The powerful 6-channel, 16,000 watt surround sound system makes every film sounds as big as it looks. From under the sea to outer space, educational films to Hollywood blockbusters, 2D to state-of-the-art 3D, IMAX makes every movie experience a moment to remember.
